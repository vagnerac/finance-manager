# Finance

This is a study purpose project.
Finance is a system to input financial transactions through API. The transactions will be inserted in a relational database.
There are a set of linked categorization to the transactions that you input also through APIs, like bank, category and transaction type (debit, credit...).
All transactions can be returned from the database to be handled in the front end.
It is necessary to have a valid username and password to use most of the APIs. The authentication is done by token (JWT).
